# NLP-Chatbot-NSTUBOT
# WEB-BASED CHATBOT USING FLASK API


In this Python web-based project , I am to build a chatbot using deep learning and flask techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. I use a special artificial neural network (ANN) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then i will give a random response from the list of responses.
chatbot using Flask, NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.

# Here are the 5 steps to create a chatbot in Flask from scratch:
1.Import and load the data file <br>
2.Preprocess data<br>
3.split the data into training and test<br>
4.Build the ANN model using keras<br>
5.Predict the outcomes<br>
6.Deploy the model in the Flask app<br>

# How to use 
1. clone git repo <br>
2. Import required python packages <br>
3. connect mysql database <br>
4. connect mongodb database <br>
5. First run traning.py <br>
6. Than app.py <br>
here data.json is data file
